## üí° Deployment Note on Live API

The free developer plan for the NewsAPI restricts live API calls to `localhost` only. As a result, the live Vercel deployment will show an API error after the initial load.

However, this project was built with an **offline-first strategy**. The application gracefully handles this by falling back to the last set of articles cached in the browser's IndexedDB, demonstrating its offline capabilities and robust error handling. The full live API functionality can be experienced by running the project on a local machine.
